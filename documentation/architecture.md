# 🏗️ Alterion Technical Architecture

This document provides a technical overview of Alterion's internal design, system structure, and key architectural decisions. It is intended for contributors, advanced users, and those interested in the language's implementation.

---

## System Overview

Alterion is built as a modular, cross-platform language and runtime. Its architecture is designed for:
- **Native compilation** (x86_64, ARM, RISC-V)
- **Universal UI rendering** (NativeUI engine)
- **Component-first programming**
- **Memory safety** (ownership, lifetimes)
- **Async-native execution**

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend
- **Lexer**: Tokenizes source code
- **Parser**: Builds AST from tokens
- **Type Checker**: Infers and validates types
- **Component Analyzer**: Validates component structure and UI tags

### 2. Intermediate Representation (IR)
- **Ownership Graph**: Tracks value ownership and lifetimes
- **Borrow Checker**: Ensures safe references
- **Async Graph**: Models async blocks and error handling

### 3. Code Generation
- **Native Backend**: Emits optimized machine code
- **Web Backend**: Emits WebAssembly and DOM bindings
- **Mobile Backend**: Emits native mobile UI code

### 4. Runtime System
- **NativeUI Engine**: Universal UI rendering for all platforms
- **Standard Library**: Core utilities, collections, async primitives
- **FFI Layer**: Interop with C/C++ libraries

## Universal NativeUI Engine

Alterion's NativeUI engine abstracts platform-specific UI details. UI tags in source code are mapped to native widgets on each platform:

- **Windows**: Win32, UWP, or WinUI
- **macOS**: Cocoa
- **Linux**: GTK, Qt
- **Web**: DOM elements via WebAssembly
- **Mobile**: Android/iOS native views

This allows developers to write UI once and deploy everywhere, with native look and feel.

---

## Memory Safety & Ownership

Alterion uses a Rust-inspired ownership and lifetime system:
- **Single ownership**: Each value has one owner
- **Borrowing**: Immutable and mutable references
- **Automatic cleanup**: RAII for resources
- **Lifetime inference**: Compiler tracks value lifetimes

This eliminates common memory errors (use-after-free, double-free, leaks) without garbage collection.

---

## Async Execution Model

Alterion's async blocks are modeled as structured concurrency graphs:
- **Async blocks**: `async { ... } [catch ...] [finally ...]`
- **Error propagation**: Catch blocks for error handling
- **Task scheduling**: Cooperative multitasking in runtime

## Key Design Decisions

- **Component-first**: All code is organized as components
- **Universal UI**: Write UI once, run everywhere
- **Native performance**: Direct compilation to machine code
- **Memory safety**: Ownership and lifetimes
- **Async-native**: Structured concurrency
- **Extensible**: FFI for C/C++ interop

---

## Roadmap (Technical)

- [x] Lexer & Parser
- [x] AST & Type Checker
- [ ] Ownership & Borrow Checker
